# LSST Sensor EO Testing
Name: SR-EOT-1
Description: Welcome to the SINGLE SENSOR ELECTRO-OPTICAL TEST traveler for any sensor.<br><br>This traveler will record the electro-optical performance of a single sensor at BNL. The work is performed at a previously selected TS3 workstation. Before beginning, TS3-1 or TS3-2 should have been identified for testing.<br> Work performed includes:<ul><li>Preparing and verifying the readiness of the TS3 workstation</li><li>Installing and removing the sensor from the TS3-Cryostat</li><li>Launching and monitoring the EO test acquisition and analyses</li></ul><br><br>Before starting, review all steps within the traveler and ensure the required equipment is available. Contact your supervisor or Subsystem Manager for any concern or additional clarification.<br><br><b>By clicking "Start Work" you indicate you:</b><ul><li>are permitted to exercise this traveler,</li><li>previewed and understand all steps beforehand,</li><li>will fulfill all prerequisites, as presented, </li><li>will follow all instructions, as presented, and,</li><li>ensure due diligence is used at each step.</li>
