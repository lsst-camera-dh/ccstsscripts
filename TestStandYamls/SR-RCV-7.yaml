     Name: TS3 cryostat warmup
     Version: next
     Description:  After the conclusion of testing, the controller is set to the POWERDOWN state. The polycold (cryo-tiger) system should be turned off. When the Dewar internal temperatures have reached a point where there is no danger of condensation, the Dewar pressure is brought up to 760torr with dry N2 gas. The window flange can then be opened and the CCD exchanged.
