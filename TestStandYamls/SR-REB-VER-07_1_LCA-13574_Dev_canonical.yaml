  height=100 width=250><br>Welcome to the TS-REB traveler for a Raft Electronics Boards
  (REB), or Science Raft (SR).<br><br><strong>THIS PROCEDURE DOES A COMPLETE FUNCTIONAL
  TEST OF THE REB ASSEMBLY USING THE TS-REB TEST SET-UP.</strong> The activities and
  testing are performed at the TS-REB station in the Science Raft Assembly and Test
  Cleanroom Facility at Brookhaven National Laboratory.<br>The details of the procedure
  are:<br><ul> <li>RTA is moved to TS-REB bench and connected to power supply and
  control computer</li> <li>5V power is applied and 5V current is verified to be within
  acceptable limits</li> <li>Data link integrity is verified</li> <li>Verify FPGA
  re-configuration  via link and JTAG/USB</li> <li>7V power rail  is brought  up and  supply
  current is verified to be within acceptable limits</li> <li>+/-15V rails brought  up
  and  supply current verified to be within acceptable limits</li> <li>+40V rail is
  brought up and supply current verified to be within acceptable limits.</li> <li>Heater
  power brought  up  and  preliminary test for proper  operation</li> <li>SPI and
  I2C links on each stripe of the REB are tested for integrity (write followed by
  read where possible)</li> <li>REB Current/Voltage and Temperature monitors are exercised
  and data logged throughout the following tests.</li> <li>ASPICs set to standard
  mode/gain/RC configuration</li> <li>RTA  is connected to EMU board</li> <li>REB
  DC biases are programmed to ITL levels</li> <li>REB multiplexer scans biases and
  verifies that commanded voltages are produced</li> <li>EMU checks that all bias
  signals are received at correct levels</li> <li>Proper functioning of the BSS cutoff
  switch is verified</li> <li>Clocks are activated to ITL levels and 550kHz pixel
  rate</li> <li>Using comparator threshold scan mode, EMU checks that clocks are received,
  have correct levels, sequence, and durations</li> <li>Steps 14  18 are repeated
  for e2v levels</li> <li>Video chain components are tested as follows:</li> <li>EMU
  issues pulse sequence: to one channel at a time, simulating full frame readout including
  clears and overscan rows/columns. Each digitized image frame is collected, displayed
  on operator terminal for verification, and screenshot recorded:</li> <li>Zero signal
  (bias) and display histograms</li> <li>checkerboard pattern, approx.. = full well,
  display image</li> <li>vertical gradient pattern, zero scale to 110% of full well
  in 2000 steps, display image</li> <li>single bright column at 90% full well, display
  image</li> <li>EMU issues checkerboard pattern at 80% full well to all channels
  simultaneously</li> <li>EMU issues vertical gradient pattern to all channels simultaneously</li>
  <li>EMU issues flat field pattern at 100% full well to all channels simultaneously</li>
  <li>Power and temperature profiles are verified to be within acceptable limits for
  all test modes.</li> <li>REB excites the CCD temperature sensor current loop, reads
  out the 4 resistor values, and verifies data returned is accurate.</li> <li>REB
  sets heater power to maximum and EMU verifies that the specified maximum makeup
  heat is delivered to the heater.</li> <li>Optionally, a temperature control loop
  is exercised using the EMUs surrogate heater and temperature sensing elements.</li>
  <li>REB is powered down using specified shutdown sequence </ul><br><br> Any failed
  test is repeated up to 3 times. If failure persists the test sequence is aborted
  and board is rejected. <br><strong>By clicking Start Work you indicate you:</strong>
  <ul> <li>are permitted to exercise this traveler,</li> <li>previewed and understand
  all steps beforehand,</li> <li>will fulfill all prerequisites, as presented,</li>
  <li>will follow all instructions, as presented, and,</li> <li>ensure due diligence
  is used at each step.</li> </ul> </p><br> <p> </p></p><p></p></div>'
