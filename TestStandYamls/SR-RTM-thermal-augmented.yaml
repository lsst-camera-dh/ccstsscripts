ShortDescription: SR-RTM-thermal-test RTM thermal augmented data acquisition traveler
Name: SR-RTM-thermal-augmented
Subsystem: SR
Description: This traveler is for acquiring the data needed for the validation of the thermal performance of RTMs. The system will be command to different heating and operating states and the thermal response is monitored.
