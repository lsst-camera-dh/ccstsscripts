Name: FullSensorCheckTask - TS2 - ST3
HardwareType: CCD
Description: Sensor delivery and inspection. The following will step you through the procedure for sensor delivery and inspection along with descriptions of the steps that should always be reread BEFORE performing the step. These sensors are extremely valuable and can be easily destroyed if the procedures are not strictly adhered to.

          Name:  RUN EDGE INSPECTION SCRIPT AND ARCHIVE IMAGE PHOTOS - ST3
          Description:   Roughly find the lower-left corner of the CCD in the image window.  Focus the camera onto the CCD surface- Apply enough light using the controller, find a flat surface, click the Basic Focus button, and click inside the box displayed. A successful focus with result in the displayed box turning green. Once focused, click the cd button in the Digital Readout Window to zero the Z-axis. Use the Crosshair Button and line up the X- and Y-axis to the lower left corner with the first quadrant. Once aligned, click the cXd and cYd buttons in the Digital Readout Window to zero out these axes. Find the lower-right corner of the CCD, and line up the axis with the second quadrant. Click the cANGd button in the Digital Readout Window to finalize the new coordinate system conveying where the CCD is on the OGP stage.  Focus the OGP laser by clicking the Laser Focus button, placing the crosshairs on the CCD surface, and clicking inside the circle. Click Open an Existing Routine to open CCDPerimeter.RTN, then click Run the Current Routine. When the first contour scan is complete, name and save the data file as CCDSerial#_Perimeter01.DAT. Let the rest of the routine finish.

          Description: Click Open an Existing Routine to open CCDSurface.RTN, then click Run the Current Routine. When the first contour scan is complete, name and save the data file as CCDSerial_Surface01.DAT. Let the rest of the routine finish. Place the cover on the CCD. Remove the CCD and place optical flat in a position on the OGP stage to ensure the area measured during the previous step is covered. To focus the OGP camera to the optical flat\u2019s surface, click Start a New Routine button, locate an area of the optical flat, click on Basic Focus and click inside the box displayed. A successful focus will result in the displayed box turning green. Then, click the cd button in the Digital Readout Window to zero the Z-axis.Focus the OGP laser by clicking the Laser Focus button, placing the crosshairs on the optical flats surface, and clicking inside the circle. Click Open an Existing Routine to open CCDSurface.RTN, then click Run the Current Routine. When the first contour scan is complete, name and save the data file as CCDSerial_SurfaceRef01.DAT. Let the rest of the routine finish. Return the optical flat to its container.
