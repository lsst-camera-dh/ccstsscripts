  Description: '<ul><li>Boards are received, serial numbers noted, photographs taken
    of both sides, eTraveler RCV step initiated</li> <li>RTA is moved to TS-REB bench
    and connected to power supply and control computer</li> <li>5V power is applied
    and 5V current is verified to be within acceptable limits</li> <li>Data link integrity
    is verified</li> <li>Verify FPGA re-configuration  via link and JTAG/USB</li>
    <li>7V power rail  is brought  up and  supply current is verified to be within
    acceptable limits</li> <li>+/-15V rails brought  up and  supply current verified
    to be within acceptable limits</li> <li>+40V rail is brought up and supply current
    verified to be within acceptable limits.</li> <li>Heater power brought  up  and  preliminary
    test for proper  operation</li> <li>SPI and I2C links on each stripe of the REB
    are tested for integrity (write followed by read where possible)</li> <li>REB
    Current/Voltage and Temperature monitors are exercised and data logged throughout
    the following tests.</li> <li>ASPICs set to standard mode/gain/RC configuration</li>
    <li>RTA  is connected to EMU board</li> <li>REB DC biases are programmed to ITL
    levels</li> <li>REB multiplexer scans biases and verifies that commanded voltages
    are produced</li> <li>EMU checks that all bias signals are received at correct
    levels</li> <li>Proper functioning of the BSS cutoff switch is verified</li> <li>Clocks
    are activated to ITL levels and 550kHz pixel rate</li> <li>Using comparator threshold
    scan mode, EMU checks that clocks are received, have correct levels, sequence,
    and durations</li> <li>Steps 14  18 are repeated for e2v levels</li> <li>Video
    chain components are tested as follows:</li> <li>EMU issues pulse sequence: to
    one channel at a time, simulating full frame readout including clears and overscan
    rows/columns. Each digitized image frame is collected, displayed on operator terminal
    for verification, and screenshot recorded:</li> <li>Zero signal (bias) and display
    histograms</li> <li>checkerboard pattern, approx.. = full well, display image</li>
    <li>vertical gradient pattern, zero scale to 110% of full well in 2000 steps,
    display image</li> <li>single bright column at 90% full well, display image</li>
    <li>EMU issues checkerboard pattern at 80% full well to all channels simultaneously</li>
    <li>EMU issues vertical gradient pattern to all channels simultaneously</li> <li>EMU
    issues flat field pattern at 100% full well to all channels simultaneously</li>
    <li>Power and temperature profiles are verified to be within acceptable limits
    for all test modes.</li> <li>REB excites the CCD temperature sensor current loop,
    reads out the 4 resistor values, and verifies data returned is accurate.</li>
    <li>REB sets heater power to maximum and EMU verifies that the specified maximum
    makeup heat is delivered to the heater.</li> <li>Optionally, a temperature control
    loop is exercised using the EMUs surrogate heater and temperature sensing elements.</li>
    <li>REB is powered down using specified shutdown sequence </ul><br><br> Any failed
    test is repeated up to 3 times. If failure persists the test sequence is aborted
    and board is rejected.'
