- {Name: Review procedure, ShortDescription: Review procedure, Description: '<ul><li>Boards are received, serial numbers noted, photographs taken of both sides, eTraveler RCV step initiated</li>
<li>RTA is moved to TS-REB bench and connected to power supply and control computer</li>
<li>5V power is applied and 5V current is verified to be within acceptable limits</li>
<li>Data link integrity is verified</li>
<li>Verify FPGA re-configuration  via link and JTAG/USB</li>
<li>7V power rail  is brought  up and  supply current is verified to be within acceptable limits</li>
<li>+/-15V rails brought  up and  supply current verified to be within acceptable limits</li>
<li>+40V rail is brought up and supply current verified to be within acceptable limits.</li>
<li>Heater power brought  up  and  preliminary test for proper  operation</li>
<li>SPI and I2C links on each stripe of the REB are tested for integrity (write followed by read where possible)</li>
<li>REB Current/Voltage and Temperature monitors are exercised and data logged throughout the following tests.</li>
<li>ASPICs set to standard mode/gain/RC configuration</li>
<li>RTA  is connected to EMU board</li>
<li>REB DC biases are programmed to ITL levels</li>
<li>REB multiplexer scans biases and verifies that commanded voltages are produced</li>
<li>EMU checks that all bias signals are received at correct levels</li>
<li>Proper functioning of the BSS cutoff switch is verified</li>
<li>Clocks are activated to ITL levels and 550kHz pixel rate</li>
<li>Using comparator threshold scan mode, EMU checks that clocks are received, have correct levels, sequence, and durations</li>
<li>Steps 14  18 are repeated for e2v levels</li>
<li>Video chain components are tested as follows:</li>
<li>EMU issues pulse sequence: to one channel at a time, simulating full frame readout including clears and overscan rows/columns. Each digitized image frame is collected, displayed on operator terminal for verification, and screenshot recorded:</li>
<li>Zero signal (bias) and display histograms</li>
<li>checkerboard pattern, approx.. = full well, display image</li>
<li>vertical gradient pattern, zero scale to 110% of full well in 2000 steps, display image</li>
<li>single bright column at 90% full well, display image</li>
<li>EMU issues checkerboard pattern at 80% full well to all channels simultaneously</li>
<li>EMU issues vertical gradient pattern to all channels simultaneously</li>
<li>EMU issues flat field pattern at 100% full well to all channels simultaneously</li>
<li>Power and temperature profiles are verified to be within acceptable limits for all test modes.</li>
<li>REB excites the CCD temperature sensor current loop, reads out the 4 resistor values, and verifies data returned is accurate.</li>
<li>REB sets heater power to maximum and EMU verifies that the specified maximum makeup heat is delivered to the heater.</li>
<li>Optionally, a temperature control loop is exercised using the EMUs surrogate heater and temperature sensing elements.</li>
<li>REB is powered down using specified shutdown sequence
</ul><br><br>
Any failed test is repeated up to 3 times. If failure persists the test sequence is aborted and board is rejected.',
