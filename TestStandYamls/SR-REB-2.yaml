    ShortDescription: current precheck
    Description:  '<ul>
  <li>6. Read the voltage and current consumption measured by the VP5 LTC2945 current monitor on the REB, record the value and compare to the current measured at the P/S.</li>
  <li>7. Apply the analog power supply voltages (VP15_UNREG, VN15_UNREG, VP7_UNREG, VP40_UNREG) to the REB in the correct sequence (check with Rick for sequence and voltage values). Abort the test if any supply hits it overcurrent limit. Readback voltages and current consumption at the P/S and at the REB LTC2945 sensors.</li> </ul>'
