    Description: 'Engage the REB thermal control loop with a setpoint such that the REB heaters are operating at 0W< Phtr < 0.5W
    Perform 16s flat exposures with low flux or fe55 at a repeating 37-s cadence
    record the heater power Phtr1 and measure the total power Ptot consumed by the REBs + RSA
    turn off the clocks, frontside and backside biases and allow the control loop to settle
    record the new heater power Phtr2'
