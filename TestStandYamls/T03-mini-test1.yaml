         Name: Sensor at TS3 - Get cryostat ready for sensor jig installation
         Description:  After loading a new device into the cryostat and performing the readout system initialization, the Dewar window is installed and the backing vacuum pump is started. If conditions warrant, the Dewar is purged with dry nitrogen gas (5X fill and evacuate). Rough pumping should proceed until the foreline pressure is below 5 mtorr, at which point the turbomolecular pump is started.

         Name: TS3 ready controller miniT1
         Description: After the CCD is installed and the controller signals have been verified, shorting plugs are removed and the CCD is connected to the controller. The controller is then powered up and a version-controlled configuration file is loaded. When the configuration parameters are APPLIED the system enters a state in which the clocks and biases are isolated from the CCD by opto-isolated solid-state relays.

         Name: TS3 cryostat warmup miniT1
         Description:  After the conclusion of testing, the controller is set to the POWERDOWN state. The polycold (cryo-tiger) system should be turned off. When the Dewar internal temperatures have reached a point where there is no danger of condensation, the Dewar pressure is brought up to 760torr with dry N2 gas. The window flange can then be opened and the CCD exchanged.
