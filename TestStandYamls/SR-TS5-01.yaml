- ShortDescription: Review and determine the disposition of the Metrology Measurement
  Name: Flatness_AbsZ_Measurement_disposition
  Description: A Technical Authority must determine the final disposition of the sensor flatness and absolute height. Based on the findings of the In-Jig dimensional metrology measurements:<br><ul><li>Click Complete if the sensor meets all specifications.<br><br></li><li>Click Stop Work if any specifications are not met. Give a detailed description of the problem(s) and contact the Sub-system Manager.</li></ul>
