ShortDescription: SR-RTM-thermal-test RTM thermal sb1 data acquisition traveler
Name: SR-RTM-thermal-sb1
Subsystem: SR
Description: This traveler is for acquiring the data needed for the validation of the thermal performance of RTMs. The system will be command to different heating and operating states and the thermal response is monitored. This implements the first thermal test proposed by S.Bellavia
