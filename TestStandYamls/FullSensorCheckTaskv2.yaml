         Description: Create a new traveler in the eTraveler system, completing the field for the CCD MANUFACTURE Serial Number. Then find the last LSST Number applied in the eTraveler. Apply the next LSST Number and record it in the traveler. Numbering scheme is as follows - XYR-ZZ, X is the vender series - 1 = e2v; 2 = ITL, YR is the year received; e.g. if a sensor is receieved in 2013, YR = 13, ZZ is the serial count, starting at 00 at the beginning of every new year.Create a new file directory on the antechambers computer for the new CCD in CCDVendorDOCS Scan each document with the scanner provided in the antechamber, noting all documentation in the CCD Receiving Logbook. List all documents received by the vender in the traveler.

         Name: TS3 ready Close window flange; connect controller - ST3
         Description: After the CCD is installed and the controller signals have been verified, shorting plugs are removed and the CCD is connected to the controller. The controller is then powered up and a version-controlled configuration file is loaded. When the configuration parameters are APPLIED the system enters a state in which the clocks and biases are isolated from the CCD by opto-isolated solid-state relays. The controller is then commanded to enter the POWER-ON state, whereby the bias and clock signals are enabled in the appropriate sequence. The DC bias currents are then checked (with clocks not running); any current which is outside its allowed limits is an indication of a poor connection or, possibly, a bad device. The next step is to activate the clocks and take a test image, with the CCD in the dark. Operators need to be trained to identify the proper appearance of a room-temperature CCD image. After these checks are complete, the controller should be set back to the POWERDOWN state and cryostat pumping and cooldown can be initiated..
