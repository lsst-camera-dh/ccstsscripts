         Version: next
         Description: <ul><li>Create a new traveler in the eTraveler system, completing the field for the CCD MANUFACTURE Serial Number.</li><li>Then find the last LSST Number applied in the eTraveler and apply the next LSST Number and record it in the traveler. Numbering scheme is as follows - XYR-ZZ, X is the vender series - 1 = e2v; 2 = ITL, YR is the year received; e.g. if a sensor is received in 2013, YR = 13, ZZ is the serial count, starting at 00 at the beginning of every new year.</li><li>Go to the <a href=http://srs.slac.stanford.edu/DataCatalog/?experiment=LSST-CAMERA>DataCatalog</a> and select LSST -> Sensor Vendor Records and find the record corresponding to the vendor serial number.</li><li>Verify that the record has a consistent model and date with those marked on the container and that they state that it passed all their tests.</li><li>Then download that record onto the local computer in the folder CCDVendorDOCS.</li><li>Finally, select the file using the eTraveler query below and then click on the record button.</li></ul>
