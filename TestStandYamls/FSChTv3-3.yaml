# For sensors that will be processed through TS1 TS2 and TS3
Name: FullSensorCheckTask - TS3
Version: next
HardwareType: CCD
Description: Sensor delivery and inspection. The following will step you through the procedure for sensor delivery and inspection along with descriptions of the steps that should always be reread BEFORE performing the step. These sensors are extremely valuable and can be easily destroyed if the procedures are not strictly adhered to.
Sequence:
   -
     Name: Sensor at TS3
     Version: next
     Description:  Initial preparation for EO testing
     Sequence:
       -
         Name: Sensor at TS3 - Get cryostat ready for sensor jig installation
         Version: next
         Description:  After loading a new device into the cryostat and performing the readout system initialization, the Dewar window is installed and the backing vacuum pump is started. If conditions warrant, the Dewar is purged with dry nitrogen gas (5X fill and evacuate). Rough pumping should proceed until the foreline pressure is below 5 mtorr, at which point the turbomolecular pump is started.

         Name: TS3 jig into cryo
         Version: next
         Description: Install jig into cryostat; connect cables. More detail is needed here and perhaps pictures demonstrating the procedure should be in the detailed instructions. See- http://www4.rcf.bnl.gov/~hneal//etraveler/instr/sensor/T01/IMAG1314.jpg , http://www4.rcf.bnl.gov/~hneal//etraveler/instr/sensor/T01/IMAG1315.jpg , http://www4.rcf.bnl.gov/~hneal//etraveler/instr/sensor/T01/IMAG1316.jpg , http://www4.rcf.bnl.gov/~hneal//etraveler/instr/sensor/T01/IMAG1317.jpg , http://www4.rcf.bnl.gov/~hneal//etraveler/instr/sensor/T01/IMAG1318.jpg , http://www4.rcf.bnl.gov/~hneal//etraveler/instr/sensor/T01/IMAG1319.jpg .

         Description: Remove cover from jig
       - 
         Name: TS3 ready Close window flange; connect controller
         Version: next
         Description: After the CCD is installed and the controller signals have been verified, shorting plugs are removed and the CCD is connected to the controller. The controller is then powered up and a version-controlled configuration file is loaded. When the configuration parameters are APPLIED the system enters a state in which the clocks and biases are isolated from the CCD by opto-isolated solid-state relays. The controller is then commanded to enter the POWER-ON state, whereby the bias and clock signals are enabled in the appropriate sequence. The DC bias currents are then checked (with clocks not running); any current which is outside its allowed limits is an indication of a poor connection or, possibly, a bad device. The next step is to activate the clocks and take a test image, with the CCD in the dark. Operators need to be trained to identify the proper appearance of a room-temperature CCD image. After these checks are complete, the controller should be set back to the POWERDOWN state and cryostat pumping and cooldown can be initiated..

         Name: TS3 pump down
         Version: next
         Description: After loading a new device into the cryostat and performing the readout system initialization, the Dewar window is installed and the backing vacuum pump is started. If conditions warrant, the Dewar is purged with dry nitrogen gas (5X fill and evacuate). Rough pumping should proceed until the foreline pressure is below 5 mtorr, at which point the turbomolecular pump is started. Pumping should proceed until the chamber pressure reaches 5x10-5 torr.

         Name: TS3 cooldown cryostat
         Version: next
         Description: Experience with the R&D Dewars at BNL and Harvard indicates that the cooldown rate will not exceed the manufacturer\u2019s recommended maximum; but if necessary, the temperature controller can be set to limit the temperature rate of change. The temperature controller control loop is enabled with setpoint at -95C and the vacuum valve is closed. Testing can begin when the temperature becomes stable at -95C.

         Name: TS3 Set up cryostat at dark box
         Version: next
         Description: After reverifying that the pressure is below  5x10-5 torr and the temperature is stable at -95C then set up the cryostat at the dark box.

         Name: run EO Acquisition Scripts
         Version: next
         Description: Verify that the CCS applications are running by clicking on the checktsappswidget. If any app is not shown as running (green) or if the widget itself is not present, please refer to the detailed instructions below. Start a new window. Do - cd /home/ts3prod/prod - then - source lcatrsetup.sh - then - cd lcatr/TS3_JH_acq - then select and paste the command provided at the next step. Verify that the acquisitions have started and that there are no inidications of problem in the CCS windows.

         Description:  After the conclusion of testing, the controller is set to the POWERDOWN state. The polycold (cryo-tiger) system should be turned off. When the Dewar internal temperatures have reached a point where there is no danger of condensation, the Dewar pressure is brought up to 760torr with dry N2 gas. The window flange can then be opened and the CCD exchanged.
