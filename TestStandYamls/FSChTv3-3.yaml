# For sensors that will be processed through TS1 TS2 and TS3
Name: FullSensorCheckTask - TS3
Version: next
HardwareType: CCD
Description: Sensor delivery and inspection. The following will step you through the procedure for sensor delivery and inspection along with descriptions of the steps that should always be reread BEFORE performing the step. These sensors are extremely valuable and can be easily destroyed if the procedures are not strictly adhered to.

     Description:  Initial preparation for EO testing
     Sequence:
       - 
         Name: TS3 - place jig into cryostat and connect cables
         Version: next
         Description: <ul><li>Fetch coffin from storage; remove covered jig.</li><li>Install jig into cryostat; connect cables. More detail is needed here and perhaps pictures demonstrating the procedure should be in the detailed instructions. See- <img src=http://www4.rcf.bnl.gov/~hneal/etraveler/instr/sensor/T01/IMAG1314.jpg> , <img src=http://www4.rcf.bnl.gov/~hneal//etraveler/instr/sensor/T01/IMAG1315.jpg></li><li>Remove cover from jig</li></ul>

         Name:  TS3 - reClose window flange; connect controller
         Version: next
         Description: After the CCD is installed and the controller signals have been verified, shorting plugs are removed and the CCD is connected to the controller.

         Version: next
         Description: <ul><li>install the Dewar window</li><li>start the backing vacuum pump</li><li>purge the Dewar with dry nitrogen gas (5X fill and evacuate). Rough pumping should proceed until the foreline pressure is below 5 mtorr, at which point the turbomolecular pump is started. Pumping should proceed until the chamber pressure reaches 5x10-5 torr.</li><li>start the turbomolecular pump a verify that the chamber pressure has dropped below 5x10-5 torr before proceeding</li></ul>

         Version:  next
         Description: You are about to start the automated execution of all acquisition and analysis scripts<br><ul><li>Verify that the CCS applications are running by clicking on the checktsappswidget.</li><li>If any app is not shown as running (green) or if the widget itself is not present, please refer to the detailed instructions below. Start a new window. Do - cd /home/ts3prod/prod - then - source lcatrsetup2.sh - then - cd lcatr/TS3_JH_acq - then select and paste the command provided when you click - start work. </li><li>Verify that the acquisitions have started and that there are no indications of problem in the CCS windows.</li><li>verify occasionally by reloading this eTraveler page or clicking - current step - that there are no failures</ul>

         Name: TS3 cryostat warmup
         Version: next
         Description:  After the conclusion of testing, the controller is set to the POWERDOWN state. The polycold (cryo-tiger) system should be turned off. When the Dewar internal temperatures have reached a point where there is no danger of condensation, the Dewar pressure is brought up to 760torr with dry N2 gas. The window flange can then be opened and the CCD exchanged.
